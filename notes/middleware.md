At its core, middleware abstracts the complexities of communication, allowing different software components—even those built with different technologies—to work together seamlessly. For example, a frontend application on a user's web browser can send a request to a web server, which then uses middleware to interact with a backend database on a different platform.

There are many different types of middleware, often categorized by their function or purpose:

Message-Oriented Middleware (MOM): Facilitates the asynchronous exchange of messages between distributed applications and systems.
Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Middleware: Enables one program to request a service from a program on another computer on the network.
Database Middleware: Provides a standard interface for applications to access and interact with database management systems, such as ODBC or JDBC.
API Middleware: Helps developers create, manage, and secure Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for their applications.

API Middleware

An API middleware functions as a "pipeline" that an incoming request passes through before reaching its destination, and that a response passes through before being sent back to the client. Each middleware function in the pipeline can execute code, modify the request and response objects, and pass the request to the next function. 
Common functions of API middleware:
Authentication and Authorization: Middleware can check for valid user credentials (authentication) and verify if a user has the proper permissions to access a resource (authorization).
Request Logging: A logging middleware can record details about every incoming request, such as the timestamp, IP address, and request path, which is useful for debugging and monitoring.

CORS Middleware

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a browser-based security mechanism that allows a web page to make requests to a server on a different "origin"—meaning a different domain, protocol, or port. Browsers implement a strict "same-origin policy" by default, which blocks cross-origin requests unless the server explicitly permits them. 

For basic requests like a GET without custom headers, the browser sends the request with an Origin header. The server's CORS middleware adds an Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to the response. If the browser's origin matches the header's value, it allows the response to be used by the web page.

Configuring CORS middleware:
Allowed Origins: A CORS middleware can be configured to allow specific origins (e.g., https://example.com) or a wildcard * to permit any origin. Specifying origins is more secure.
Allowed Methods: You can define which HTTP methods are permitted for cross-origin requests (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
Allowed Headers: You can specify which custom headers clients are allowed to send in cross-origin requests.
Credentials: You can enable the use of credentials (like cookies and HTTP authentication) with cross-origin requests by setting Access-Control-Allow-Credentials to true. This requires specifying a concrete origin, not a wildcard.
